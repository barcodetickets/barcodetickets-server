==========================
_Copyright 2010-2013 Frederick Ding & Kirill Peretoltchine_

The BTS project aims to provide an efficient means of electronic event management, with barcoded tickets for quick sales and check-ins, licensed under the Apache License 2.0. 

This is the **server** component of BTS -- the PHP application that hosts the XML/JSON API and presents the administration interface. The **client** component is still currently on [a SourceForge Subversion repository](https://svn.code.sf.net/p/barcodetickets/code/).
